Idea is to develop a independent add-on (preferable VST) for acoustical physical modelling of different shapes of saxophones to play as an virtual instrument in real-time through f.x. MIDI controller. We will use open source tools and make a free closed product for artists.

The modelling will be calculated from OpenWinD library, JUCE VST creator and "popsicle" library for Python-JUCE integration.

The next milestone is to simulate all typical woodwind instruments through calculation many combinations of waveguides, throats and nozzles to learn a deep-learing algorithm to predict a physical synthesis of physics of woodwind acoustics, such as transmittance, nonlinearities, types of excitations, special sound production and articullations.

These machine learned results will be used for accelerate future add-on and create an AI predication of specifics of woodwinds.

The project will be used for next generation of physical modelling synths using AI prediction f.x. Hammond organ nonlinear (AI assisted) synthesis.
